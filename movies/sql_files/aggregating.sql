TABLE ratings;
SELECT movieid , count(rating) AS count_movie_ratings FROM ratings

--7 Another metric that we could use to measure the popularity of the movies is the average rating. 
-- However, to ensure the quality of this information we need to have at least a given 
-- number of ratings. What are the most popular movies using this metric?
TABLE ratings;

SELECT movieid, avg(rating) AS avg_rating , count(rating) FROM ratings 
GROUP BY movieid
HAVING count(rating) >= 50
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
-- Display the top 10 highest rated movies by average that have at least 50 ratings.

--8 Imagine that you would like to continue focusing on the drama movies only. 
-- As you have multiple questions about drama movies you decided to create a view representing 
-- drama movies that you could reuse later on.

-- Create a view that is a table of only movies that contain drama as one of itâ€™s genres. 

CREATE VIEW new_drama_view AS 
SELECT * 
FROM movies 
WHERE genres  = 'Drama';

-- Display the first 10 movies in the view.
SELECT * FROM new_drama_view LIMIT 10;
